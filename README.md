# K-Means-clustering-on-Penguins-data
From Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate Program
## Overview
Using K Means clustering to group a dataset of penguins. Inertia and Silhoutte scores gives the best value of k as 6. The K-means clustering enabled this data to be effectively grouped. It helped identify patterns.
## Data Understanding
The project is done using the penguins dataset in Seaborn library. The dataset contains 7 features for 344 penguins. There are 3 types of penguins in the dataset - Adelie, Gentoo and Chinstrap. For purposes of clustering, we pretend we don't know that there are three different types of species. Also, when a new penguin data is added, we can determine which cluster the penguin belongs to.
## Modeling and Evaluation
The elbow plot and especially the silhouette scores suggests that 6 clusters are optimal for this data. Having 6 clusters makes sense because the study suggests that there is sexual dimorphism (differences between the sexes) for each of the three species (2 sexes * 3 different species = 6 clusters).

## Conclusion
The K-means clustering enabled this data to be effectively grouped.
